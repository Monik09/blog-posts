## Whats' DevOps

If you are quite active on social media, you might have heard about DevOps, cloud, docker and many more. And wondering what exactly going up there in the cloud :). 

Voila, wait we will be going to understand each one of these in detail in the following articles.

In this article, you are going to start with dev ops.

## So, what exactly is Dev Ops?

DevOps stands for Developer Operations. So it generally implies to be the combination of developer and operations. It is a practice which helps developer teams and operation teams to work together and provide software at greater velocity and better feedback.

It is a software engineering practice which focuses on providing teams with better communication and feedback mechanisms than agile and waterfall development.

Its lifecycle includes:
- **Planning**: The team should adopt agile practices to increase speed and quality
- **Build** 
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery**: Continuous Integrations help to release software at a faster pace with automated workflows.
- **Continuous Feedback**: The developer and operation team should evaluate each release and improve the future releases/
- **Operate**: This phase included monitoring, maintaining and troubleshooting applications in production environments.

## Why DevOps?

1. Faster Production
2. Speed
3. Scalability
4. Collaboration
5. Improved Mean Time to recovery


So we have gone through the benefits of DevOps and why you should be using it. But as with other software development techniques, this type of planning may not be suitable for your workflow. Let's look at when you should refrain from using DevOps.

## When not DevOps?

You should not prefer going for DevOps workflow if you are either having irregular software releases or your software is currently a legacy one or the old architecture is still being used.
